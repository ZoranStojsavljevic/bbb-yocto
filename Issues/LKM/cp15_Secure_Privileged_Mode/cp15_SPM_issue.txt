Usually I use off the shelf systems (various Linux distros) to set up the BBB, as referent systems design platform.

Recently, I have started to dive more deep into the armv7 A8 programming model. And I found confusing areas (I have concrete questions to ask).

Namely, I would like to read the Secure Configuration Register:
http://infocenter.arm.com/help/topic/com.arm.doc.ddi0344k/DDI0344K_cortex_a8_r3p2_trm.pdf#page=133

For this purpose, I wrote iny driver, which is presented here (cp15-spm.c).
https://github.com/ZoranStojsavljevic/bbb-yocto/blob/master/Issues/LKM/cp15_Secure_Privileged_Mode/cp15_spm.c

While reading the first time CPSR register, I got the following value: 0x60000013 (b10011 Supervisor Mode) - I am root/superuser.

I tried to set CPSR mode (LSB 5 bits) to the b10110 Secure Monitor Mode, but it seems that with the above presented code I am NOT able to do that!

While executing the following code:
asm volatile("mrc p15, 0, %0, c1, c1, 0" : "=r"(reg_value) );
printk(KERN_INFO "Secure Configuration Register data: 0x%08x\n", reg_value);Code

I've got the following: Internal error: Oops - undefined instruction: 0 [#1] ARM

The full log is presented here (cp15_spm_execution_traces.txt):
https://github.com/ZoranStojsavljevic/bbb-yocto/blob/master/Issues/LKM/cp15_Secure_Privileged_Mode/cp15_spm_execution_traces.txt

Could you, please, show me the code snippet which switches Supervisor Mode to Secure Monitor Mode (if at all possible)?

Thank you!
